			<p>The image below shows my initial concept for a Fortnite level created in UEFN. The design is inspired by escape rooms and the player must progress through a series of these rooms to reach the end.</p>
			<p>The diagram on the right shows how I imagined an individual space would look.</p>

			<p>This was my initial concept for how the player might navigate Stage 1. I aimed to keep the layout simple and intuitive, The player choosing an incorrect path wouldn't result in a harsh penalty, allowing for smooth and forgiving exploration of the mechanics.</p>

			<p>This image highlights the stage in more detail, showcasing the design techniques I used to guide players in the right direction. I chose to annotate flow because the player's goal is to complete the level as quickly as possible. Areas within each stage that felt fast to move through tended to get a reaction from the player. I identified this high-flow area during playtesting.</p>

			<p>In this level, the player must navigate through the environment to reach and jump onto a ledge. If they miss the jump, they'll fall but can backtrack through the level to return to the starting point and try again.</p>
