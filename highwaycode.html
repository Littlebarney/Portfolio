				<div class="text-box">
				<p>This was my initial level design concept, created before all core mechanics had been finalized by the team. To inform key design decisions. I referenced established driving games with a "open worlds," ensuring the layout would feel intuitive and engaging for players, even in the early iterations.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
				<p>The game required players to deliver packages this involved stopping outside each "shop" to make the drop-off. This disrupteded the pacing and flow of the level. In this iteration, I redesigned the layout so that each shop is placed along in a loop, allowing players to maintain momentum while completing deliveries.</p>

				<p> In this iteration, I added extra buildings to make the world feel more lived-in and to subtly direct players along intended paths, preventing easy shortcuts.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
				<p> After co-op gameplay was confirmed, I reworked the map to include twice as many objectives, positioned near their original locations. This layout encouraged players to intersect more frequently, creating opportunities for competition and engagement.</p>

				<p>Once ramps were proposed, I changed the layout of the map. I placed them at the end of long straights to ensure players had enough runway to gain momentum, enhancing both gameplay flow and functionality.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
				<p>In this iteration, I further urbanised the map by adding more environmental details and structural elements. This helped restrict potential shortcuts, ensuring a fairer experience for all players—regardless of how familiar they were with the game.</p>

				<div class="text-box">
				<p>To support the AI system another team member was developing, I redesigned the map into a more grid-based layout as the AI relied on the spline system. This allowed for easier AI navigation.</p>

				<p>As part of a team effort to create a more immersive and believable game world, I removed select buildings and introduced pavements in their place, giving the city a greater sense of life and structure.</p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> In the final iteration, I focused on how to define the map's boundary. Rather than using walls, fences, or invisible barriers, we choose a more American style incident barrier. These formed a realistic obstacle for the players. These barriers are placed where the roads end, keeping the design believable and consistent while preventing players from leaving the playable area. </p>
