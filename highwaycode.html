				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> This was my initial plan for the level. At this point, the team had not decided on all of the mechanics yet. This meant that I relied on other driving games of a similar style to inform some of the design decisions, for example, the width of the road, how tight turns were. </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> The game required for players to drop of packages. The previous iteration required them to stop outside of the "shops" to drop them off. This would have had a huge impact on the pacing and flow of the level and therefor the game. In this iteration I made sure that each "shop" was situated on a loop. </p>

				<p> In this iteration I made the map feel more "lived in" and prevented players from easily shortcutting to different areas with extra buildings. </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> This is the iteration I developed when I found out that we were going for a co-op game (for certain.) As you can see, I doubled the amount of objectives while keeping them relatively in the same place. This meant that the two players would come across eachother during the gameplay, fostering the competitve spirit most games run off. </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> Ramps were theorised right about now, so I had to redesign the map with this in mind. I placed them at the end of long straights, this way players could build up speed before them.  </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> I further urbanised the map in this iteration, further preventing players from taking shortcuts that they could use as an advantage against another player. I didnt want a player to have an advantage because they have played the game before. </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> This iteration made the map more "grid" like. This was because of the AI system a team member was developing. This AI system relied on a set of premade splines that were not developed with the map in mind. Therefor it was never going to work with the previous iterations layout </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> As a team we wanted to bring more life to the game, make the city feel lived in rather than a holo city, where only the players reside. Therefor I took some buildings away and added pavements in there place.  </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> This iteration was made to allow for a new system that was decided on. It would ultimatly allow for players to make it more difficult for the other player when they were delivering packages. </p>

				<div class="aln-middle">
				<p> In the final iteration I began to think about how the map "ends." Does it end with a wall? a row of fences, an invisible barrier. In the end we went for something that a player may have seen in the real world or on the news. American incident barriers. This is why the roads at the edge of the map simply move off into nothing. These barriers were placed on these roads to prevent players from moving off the map. </p>
